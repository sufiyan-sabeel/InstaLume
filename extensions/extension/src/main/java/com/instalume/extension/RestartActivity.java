 * One-shot relay that makes "clear cache and restart" actually restart.
 *
 * The dying process cannot bring itself back: an activity it starts just before
 * killing itself is dropped by the system ("app died, no saved state"), and one
 * queued for after the kill (an alarm PendingIntent) is refused as a background
 * activity launch. So the relay runs in a process of its own — declared by the
 * Restart relay patch — kills the main process from the outside, and only then
 * starts Instagram from its own live foreground window.
