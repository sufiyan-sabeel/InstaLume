/**
 * Watches the bottom tab bar until the "feed_tab" child (the Home button at the
 * bottom-left) is inflated, then installs a long-press listener on it that opens
 * the InstaLume settings, and detaches.
 *
 * This is the sole settings entry point. An injected action-bar button was tried
 * but failed to appear on many devices, since it depends on the feed's top action
 * bar being present and laid out a particular way. Long-pressing Home only needs
 * the tab bar, which always exists, so settings stay reachable everywhere. The id
 * is resolved by name (with a clone fallback) so it survives Instagram version bumps.
